Proposal of ABCD
---

# Objectives

> What are you trying to do? Articulate your `objectives` using absolutely `no jargon`.

# Current Situation

> How is it done today, and what are the `limits of current practice`?

> Why are improvements needed?

# Approach

> What is new in your approach and `why` do you think it will be `successful`?

> For instance, have you done some experiment in a small scope?

> Note: Proposing too much work is risky

# Stakeholders

> Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make? 

> Who can get what kind of benefit from the project?

> Note: Having too many stakeholders is risky

# Risks

> What are the risks? 

> Why is the potential return worth the investment?

> How to mitigate risks?

> Do we have Plan B and what is it?

# Cost

> How much will it cost? 

> Cost includes
> + Money
> + Time
> + People
> + Equipments

> Note: 
> + Sales & Marketing cost and support cost etc. should also be included if required.
> + It's risky to request too big cost

# Life Cycle

> How long will it take?

> Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling and Closing? 

# Milestones

> What are the mid-term and final `"exams"` to check for success?
